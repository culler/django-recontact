Description
-----------

The recontact package is a pluggable django application which provides
a contact form that generates an email message to specified addresses.
The form is protected by a Google invisible recaptcha.

Installation
------------

Install with pip::

$ python3 -m pip install django-recontact.

Example
-------

A minimal Django project is included, with an example contact form.

To set up the example server, run the following commands::

   $ python3 -m venv pythonenv
   $ source pythonenv/bin/activate
   $ python -m pip install django
   $ python setup.py install
   $ cd example
   $ python manage.py migrate
   $ python manage.py runserver

You should now have an http server running on localhost port 8000.
Connect to localhost:8000 with your web browser to test the form.

Usage
-----

To minimally deploy this app in your Django project you need to do the following:

* Add 'recontact' to INSTALLED_APPS in your project settings.py file.
* Add the following to the urlpatterns list in your project urls.py::
    
      url(r'^contact/', include('recontact.urls')),

  (Modify the regular expression r'^contact/' if you want a different url.)
* Configure the app as described in the next section.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the app you must define a dict named RECONTACT_CONFIG in
your project's ``settings.py``.  This dict, which is used in the
example, shows the default values of all of the parameters::

  # Default configuration for the recontact app
  RECONTACT_CONFIG = {
      'template_name': 'recontact/contact.html',
      'confirmation_template_name': 'recontact/message_sent.html',
      'addresses': ['postmaster@localhost'],
      'extra_context': {},
      'query': 'Recontact query:',
      'site_key': '6LeIxAcTAAAAAJcZVRqyHh71UMIEGNQ_MXjiZKhI',
  }

The site_key shown above is Google's testing key.  It does no checking
and displays a badge with a red warning printed across it.  You will
need to register your site with recaptcha and use a real site_key
provided by Google.

The value of 'addresses' is either a list of the email addresses to
which the contact email generated by the app should be sent, or a
callable which returns such a list.  In the latter case, the callable
will be passed the same arguments as the post method of the
RecontactView.  In particular, if you have named arguments in the url
regex then these will be passed.

The value of extra_context may be a dict containing context to be
used when rendering the contact page and acknowledgment page, or a
callable which returns such a dict.

The two templates which are provided with the app are minimal and have
no styling.  You will want to modify these to your taste.  The first
template manages a form which sends the contact email.  The second
simply informs the user that a message has been sent.  You should use
the first two dict entries to specify the locations of your templates.

The 'query' value is used to generate the subject line of the contact
email, which also contains the name provided on the contact form.  You
should assign a value which allows you to recognize which Django project
generated the message.
